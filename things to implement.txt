Not Yet Implemented:
diff status, variations in contact types, variations of environment
status of sickness
snake-like movement, line
familie movement, cluster moving down hallway movement
continuous transmission (post-processing v.s. processing rn???)

look up average degree of motion in hallways


Implemented:
two way hallways
cluster/community movement
bouncing off walls
increase velocity to check if asymptotic behavior changes (x0.5)
increase velocity to check if asymptotic behavior changes (x2)
increase velocity to check if asymptotic behavior changes (x1.5)
200 agents vs size
You had mentioned about simulating your school hallway as an experiment. Are you still interested in that?
compare hallway v.s. room
avg contact time v.s. size of the room / agents
Can you think of a way to increase contact duration in simulation? Instead of 5 seconds, can we increase to 5min?
Is there a way to time these contacts? In real life, manual contact tracing would say Agent 1 was in contact with Agent 12 for 30 min on MM/DD//YY. This can be useful to identify the time between exposure and onset of symptoms.
